            <p>
              We endeavour to begin working on your registration applications
              immediately after you have submitted them to us. For this purpose,
              you authorise us (through our business division honcho.com.au) or
              our nominated representative, as relevant, to act as:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                your registered tax agent on your behalf, in your application
                for an ABN, TFN or for GST and PAYG registration;
              </li>
              <li>
                your ASIC registered agent on your behalf, in your application

                renewals; and

              Submission of any application form through the Website does not

            <p>
              If your application needs to be reviewed manually by ASIC or the

              the registration not being successful.
            </p>

              While we will try to overcome objections on your behalf for any
              application, we do not make any warranty or guarantee that we will
              be able to do so. If the response does not successfully overcome
              the objection, we will cancel your relevant application and refund
              your application fee, minus a reasonable service fee for our
              Services.

            <p>
              An ABN must be obtained before a person can register for GST,
              secure a Business Name or register a domain name with the Top
              Level Domain (TLD) .com.au. If you do not obtain an ABN, then we
              may not be able to provide these services to you.

            <h2>Company names Business Names</h2>

            <p>
              Company and Business Name availability checks carried out via the
              relevant company or Business Name application form on the Website
              are dependent on the ASIC Check Name Availability register (ASIC
              Register). We are not responsible for any errors or omissions on
              the ASIC Register or if the ASIC Register or its system is
              experiencing technical issues, such as downtime or maintenance.
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not make any warranties as to the registrability of your
              company or Business Name.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your chosen company name or Business Name is not available to
              you, on carrying out the availability check via the application
              form, your application will not proceed using that company name or
              Business Name.
            </p>
            <p>
              We try to submit your application to ASIC as soon as possible
              after receipt of your application. If, for any reason, your chosen
              company name or Business Name is no longer available to you when
              we submit your application, we will notify you as soon as possible
              so that you can select a different company or Business Name. We
              are not liable for any direct or indirect loss, costs or damage
              incurred or suffered by you due to your chosen company name or
              Business Name not being available for registration.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the ASIC Register is not available for any reason, we can
              manually file your company or Business Name application. If we do
              so, we cannot check the ASIC Register to see if your company name
              or Business Name is available. If your chosen name is then
              unavailable you can either:
              <ul>
                <li>choose another company name or Business Name; or</li>
                <li>
                  obtain a full refund of your application fees from us, less a
                  reasonable administration and handling fee (Administration
                  Charge).
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              If you do not make the election referred to in paragraph 26.(e)
              above, within 10 days of us notifying you that your company name
              or Business Name is unavailable, we will just provide you with the
              refund referred to in paragraph 26.(e).(ii).
            </p>
            <p>
              If your company registration or Business Name application requires
              manual review by ASIC, due to an issue with the chosen name, we
              may need further evidence of your right to use certain terms. If
              you do not provide the requested information within the relevant
              time period, as notified by us, then your Business Name or company
              registration application may be discontinued.

            <p>
              Registration of a company name, Business Name or domain name
              (collectively and individually, Name) does not prevent third

            <p>
              We can cancel a Business Name registration you hold if you
              authorise us to do so. Before cancelling your Business Name
              registration, we will need to be recorded as your ASIC agent
              (which we will arrange).
            </p>
            <p>
              If the application to cancel your Business Name is rejected, we
              will identify the reason for rejection, notify you of the
              rejection and await your further instructions.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you authorise us to cancel your Business Name, we are not

            <h2>ABN, GST, PAYG, and TFN registration</h2>
            <p>In order to use the TFN registration services, you must be:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>a company; and</li>
              <li>legally entitled to apply for a TFN.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We endeavour to begin working on your registration application
              immediately after you have submitted it to us.
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not provide any advice relating to whether you need to apply
              for an ABN or TFN or register for GST or PAYG.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we cannot arrange for your ABN, GST or PAYG registration
              application to be processed by the ATO immediately through our
              electronic system, we will review your application and manually
              apply for such registration on your behalf.
            </p>
            <p>
              In certain circumstances, for a small number of clients, and based
              on the specifics of an individual’s application, the ATO
              stipulates that we must wait up to 28 days from the date that the
              application is lodged before contacting it to resolve the issue.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your application is placed under review by the ATO, sometimes
              the ATO may notify you directly by post to the address listed in
              your application. This usually occurs within 14 days of the date
              that we file an application on your behalf.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your application is rejected by the ATO it may be for any
              number of reasons. These may include (but are not limited to):
              <ul>
                <li>
                  the information supplied does not match exactly with
                  information the ATO has on record;
                </li>
                <li>
                  you have previously applied for, or currentlyhave an ABN or
                  TFN; or
                </li>
                <li>
                  the ATO is experiencing system processing issues, such as
                  system downtime or maintenance.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              If your application for an ABN is rejected by the ATO, we will
              contact you to discuss other options to establish your business.
              If you choose not to proceed, we will cancel your application and
              provide you with a full refund less the Administration Charge.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you apply for a Business Name and ABN together and if your ABN
              is refused, then we will cancel both your ABN and Business Name
              applications as you must have an ABN to successfully register a
              Business Name.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will advise you as soon as we have secured your ABN, TFN, GST
              or PAYG registration.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your business has been sold, closed down, has changed its
              structure or is no longer operating in Australia (or making
              supplies in connection with Australia), you should cancel your
              ABN. We can cancel your ABN on your behalf. Before cancelling your
              ABN, we will need to be recorded as your business’ registered tax
              agent (which we will arrange).
            </p>
            <p>
              Before cancelling your ABN, you must ensure that all lodgment,
              reporting and payment obligations in respect of the government
              agencies your business deals with have been addressed, for
              example, the business may be required to lodge activity statements
              or PAYG withholding reports with the ATO.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cancelling your ABN will result in:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  the following additional registrations being cancelled
                  automatically: GST, PAYG, Luxury Car Tax and Wine Equalization
                  Tax registrations. Any Fuel Tax Credits attached to the ABN
                  will also be cancelled.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The cancellation of any login credentials that any
                  representatives of your business hold which may prevent the
                  representatives from using government online services.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              If the application to cancel your ABN is rejected, we will
              identify the reason for the rejection, notify you of the rejection
              and wait your further instructions.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you authorise us to cancel your ABN, we are not liable for any
              loss or damage suffered by you due to the cancellation of your ABN
              (and the automatic cancellation of any associated registrations).

              If you are overseas, we may require further information to support
              your application for a virtual address.
            </p>
            <p>
              We reserve the right to immediately terminate the virtual address
              service provided to you if we reasonably determine that your
              business activity is illegal or is likely to bring our address or
              business into disrepute.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the virtual address service is cancelled for any reason, we
              will provide reasonable notice to you where possible. We are not
              responsible for receipt or delivery of any correspondence received
              by us for you after such cancellation.
            </p>
            <p>
              The virtual address service is not appropriate for delivery of
              large, heavy or bulky items. We will accept and deliver letters
              and packages to you that are of a reasonable size and weight
              appropriate to delivery to a business address.
            </p>
            <p>
              We reserve the right to:
              <ul>
                <li>reject any delivery made to our address; or</li>
                <li>refuse to deliver any goods to you,</li>
              </ul>
              if the package or goods are not of a reasonable size and weight as
              reasonably determined by us.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we accept delivery of packages or goods which we reasonably
              deem to be of unreasonable size or weight, we will promptly notify
              you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any deliveries which we do not deliver to you due to the size or
              weight of the package must be picked up within 7 days of our
              notification to you of our receipt of such packages, otherwise a
              storage charge of AUD$12 (plus GST) per day after the 7 day period
              will be automatically charged to you.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we do agree to deliver such packages to you, you will be liable
              to pay the delivery fee charged by our agent (which we will notify
              to you), plus a reasonable surcharge that will cover our
              administrative expenses, which is payable to us prior to the
              package being shipped to you. We will notify you in advance of the
              delivery fee and our surcharge before you incur any costs.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the delivery of your letters and packages is dependent on third
              parties, we are not responsible or liable for any lost or damaged
              deliveries to you unless the loss is a result of our negligence.
              If you have a complaint regarding any delivery or failed delivery
              to you, please contact the relevant postal or courier service. We
              will provide all reasonable assistance required.
            </p>
            <p>
              You understand and accept that our virtual address services will
              not operate in the event of any shutdown due to any public health
              order or mandatory stop work order.

              Neither we, nor Applied Marks, provide pre-application searches to

              obtain legal advice from a lawyer or trademarks attorney.

            <p>
              If an application for a trademark is not accepted by IP Australia
              for any reason, you will receive a written Examination Report from
              IP Australia (Examination Report) explaining the issues and the

              You are restricted to the registration of one domain name under
              any annual or monthly subscription plan. Any additional domain
              names can be applied for as an additional Service.
            </p>
            <p>
              Services, such as ABN registration, are subject to a one off fee
              which is payable to us. Unless otherwise specified in these Terms,
              such fees and charges must be paid by you on submission of the
              relevant application forms. Application forms will not be
              successfully submitted until you pay all relevant fees and
              charges.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unless otherwise stated, all fees and charges are in Australian
              dollars.
            </p>
            <p>
              The fees are inclusive of goods and services tax (GST) where
              applicable.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you do not pay any of your fees within the relevant period
              requested by us and after we inform you of any non payment, then
              without prejudice to our other rights, we reserve the right to
              restrict your access to any of our Services or downgrade your
              subscription level.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may provide some Services to you free of charge, at our
              discretion. We reserve the right to charge fees for any such
              Services at any later time, at our discretion.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will provide you with reasonable notice (at least 30 days’
              notice) in writing of any new fees or changes to existing fees
              prior to commencing charging such fees. Your continued use of such
              Services will constitute your acceptance of such amendments to our
              fees.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you do not agree to our new or amended fees, then you must
              notify us in writing of such, within 10 days of the date that we
              issue a notification to you relating to a change in our fees. You
              will then be entitled to terminate your subscription or any future
              Services without penalty and receive a refund of any fees paid in
              advance.
            </p>
            <h2>Refunds</h2>
            <p>
              You may terminate these Terms in the event that we have committed
              a material breach of our obligations under these Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our Services come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under
              the ACL.
            </p>
            <p>
              For major failures with our Services or a minor failure that
              cannot be fixed within a reasonable time, you have the right to
              cancel the Services you receive from us, if the Services are:
              <ul>
                <li>provided with an unacceptable level of care and skill;</li>
                <li>unfit for the purpose you asked for; or</li>
                <li>
                  not delivered within a reasonable time when there is no agreed
                  end date.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              If you cancel the Services for the reasons outlined in paragraph
              40.(c) above, we will provide you with a refund of your fee in the
              same form as your original payment, in accordance with these
              Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              To the extent permitted by law, including the ACL, we do not
              otherwise provide any refund of fees paid in connection with the
              Services except as stated in these Terms, including:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  if you notify us that you would like to withdraw your
                  application before we have initiated the registration process.
                  In such circumstances, we may provide you with a full refund
                  less the Administration Charge. However, as our services are
                  automated and synchronise in real time with the relevant
                  Commonwealth government agency, we generally commence our
                  Services as soon as you complete your application and pay the
                  relevant application fee. The decision whether to provide you
                  with a refund under such circumstances is at our own
                  discretion, acting reasonably; or
                </li>
                <li>
                  if an ABN application has been submitted and put on hold and
                  not issued and you then want to withdraw your application, we
                  may provide you with a refund of the ABN application fee,
                  excluding a reasonable charge for the use of our Services.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              You acknowledge and agree that all trademark fees paid by you to
              us for the Trademark Services are payable in advance and, subject
              to the ACL or any other breach of these Terms or negligence by us,
              non-refundable. To the extent permitted by law, we will not be
              held liable for any costs, damages, or claims that may arise due
              to non-registration or non-renewal of your trademark.

              Services.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our total liability in respect of any Service, whether based on

              inability to use our Services or any other matter relating to the
              Services.
            </p>

            <h2>Termination and Suspension</h2>
            <p>
              We may terminate or suspend your access to our Services
              immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason
              whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.
              Upon termination, your right to use the Services will cease
              immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue
              using the Services. All provisions of the Terms which by their
              nature should survive termination shall survive termination,
              including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty
              disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.
            </p>
            <h2>Changes to Terms and Services</h2>
            <p>
              We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace
              these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will try to
              provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking
              effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at
              our sole discretion.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also reserve the right to alter, update, or discontinue our
              Services (or any part or content thereof) without prior notice at
              any time. We shall not be liable to you or to any third-party for
              any modification, price change, suspension, or discontinuance of
              the Service.
            </p>
            <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
            <p>
              If a dispute arises out of or in connection with these Terms or
              the use of our Services, the parties agree to first attempt to
              negotiate any dispute informally for at least 30 days before
              initiating any court or arbitration proceedings. Such negotiations
              will commence upon written notice from one party to the other.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the dispute cannot be resolved through informal negotiations,
              it shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding
              arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final
              and binding on the other. The arbitration proceedings shall be
              conducted under the rules of an agreed-upon arbitration
              association in a location mutually agreed upon by the parties.
            </p>
            <p>
              An arbitrator's decision and judgment thereon shall have the force
              of law. You agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in the
              English language and that the arbitrator must comply with the
              provisions of these Terms.
            </p>
            <h2>Governing Law</h2>
            <p>
              These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the
              laws of New South Wales, Australia, without regard to its conflict
              of law provisions. Our failure to enforce any right or provision
              of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If
              any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or
              unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms
              will remain in effect.
            </p>
            <p>
              You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts
              located in New South Wales, Australia, for the purpose of
              litigating all such disputes.
            </p>
            <h2>General Provisions</h2>
            <p>
              These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding

              We may assign or transfer our rights and obligations under these
              Terms to any party at any time without notice to you, but this
              will not affect your rights or our obligations under these Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may not assign or transfer your rights or obligations under
              these Terms without our prior written consent.
